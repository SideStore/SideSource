# SideSource

SideSource is the Cloudflare Worker that powers [apps.sidestore.io](https://apps.sidestore.io) using GitHub's release API, caching and [an overrides system](./overrides/), along with a key protected preview and cache resetting system.

If you're interested in making a Cloudflare Worker powered source for your own app, make sure to check out [sidestore-source-types](https://github.com/SideStore/sidestore-source-types) for fully documented SideStore source type definitions.
